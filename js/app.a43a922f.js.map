In this case, you might want to\r\n          create a new domain in which the Sun Management Center groups are\r\n          structured on physical lines. Cities, sites, buildings, floors, server\r\n          rooms and even equipment racks can easily be represented. The systems\r\n          at these locations can be copied and pasted from the domain in which\r\n          discovery was performed using the Discovery Manager. To configure a\r\n          Sun Management Center environment along physical lines requires you to\r\n          know where the systems are physically located. This organization can\r\n          become a valuable and easily accessed reference. A physical\r\n          organization also defines a status roll-up path, enabling problems to\r\n          be isolated on physical lines and assisting in the identification of\r\n          common-mode failures. For example, a localized power outage might\r\n          affect systems that reside on several networks but will only appear in\r\n          one physical area.\r\n        </b-card-text>\r\n        <b-button pill class=\"custom-button\">Apply Now</b-button>\r\n      </b-card>\r\n\r\n      <b-card title=\"Client Organization\" class=\"custom-card\">\r\n        <b-card-text>\r\n          A Logical Organization™ is one that understanding the new rules of\r\n          engagement in the digital world – and how to use business insight to\r\n          make better decisions.
